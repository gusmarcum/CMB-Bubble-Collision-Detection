# CMB Bubble Collision Screening

Planck-era machine-learning and classical candidate screening for localized
bubble-collision signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background.

## Assumptions

- This repository implements a **candidate-screening front end**, not a
  cosmological detection claim.
- It does not compute a Feeney-style Bayesian evidence ratio, a posterior over
  collision parameters, or a constraint on the expected number of detectable
  collisions.
- Paper-facing wording guardrails live in
  `docs/manuscript_framing_candidate_screening.md`.
- Signal amplitudes are dimensionless fractional temperature modulations
  (`Delta T / T`); stored patch tensors are CMB anisotropies in Kelvin.
- Current science artifacts use `Nside=256`, `256 x 256` gnomonic patches,
  Planck `5 arcmin` beam handling, `synfast(pixwin=True)`, and mixed
  contained/truncated signal geometry.
- All operating thresholds are screening thresholds. They are valid only for
  the calibration distribution named with the result.

## Current Directive

The active claim is deliberately narrow:

> A reproducible Planck-era candidate-screening method for localized
> bubble-collision signatures, intended to accelerate or supplement
> classical/Bayesian follow-up.

Framing rule for any manuscript or talk built from this repo: describe outputs
as candidate screening, sensitivity calibration, candidate-volume accounting,
or screening-derived handoff products. Do not describe the current artifacts as
standalone cosmological detection evidence.

Use `remediated_v1` as the current artifact family. Treat `training_v4`,
`validation_stratified_v1`, old `matched_template` reports, and the old
best-branch `8 / 35` heatmap as historical development artifacts.

## Remediated v1

Primary products:

| product | rows | role |
|---|---:|---|
| `data/remediated_v1/training_data.h5` | `20000` | train/calibration/test source, split `16000/2000/2000` |
| `data/remediated_v1/calibration_data.h5` | `2000` | threshold calibration copy |
| `data/remediated_v1/test_data.h5` | `2000` | held-out final synthetic test copy |
| `data/remediated_v1/null_controls_{map}_{mask}.h5` | `16000` each | real-map null controls for `smica,nilc,sevem,commander` and `mask090,mask050` |

The current generator/audit contract is:

- Feeney-style linear-cap disc template with full-temperature modulation
  (`feeney2011_full_temperature_modulation`). McEwen/OSS matched-filter
  benchmarks use the first-order additive approximation and must record that
  convention separately.
- `mask_threshold = 0.9` for canonical science products.
- `mask_threshold = 0.5` null controls retained for deployment stress tests.
- Planck cleaned-map beam modeled as `5 arcmin`.
- Beam/pixel-window transfer handled in harmonic space for current synthetic
  products.
- Geometry and harmonic work use `float64`; stored tensors use `float32` after
  finite/range checks.
- Splits are train/calibration/test and coordinate-cluster/CAMB-realization
  disjoint.

## Current Results

Held-out remediated synthetic test, thresholds selected on the calibration
split:

| method | score mode | threshold | precision | recall | FPR | F1 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ImageNet EfficientNet-B0 U-Net | `component_score` | `0.96` | `0.888` | `0.396` | `0.050` | `0.548` |
| random-init EfficientNet-B0 U-Net | `component_score` | `0.99` | `0.819` | `0.362` | `0.080` | `0.502` |
| `circular_template_screen` | fixed from calibration | `65.0217` | `0.921` | `0.267` | `0.023` | `0.414` |

The preselected ImageNet-vs-`circular_template_screen` sensitivity heatmap uses
paired bootstrap tests with Holm and Benjamini-Hochberg correction. It reports:

- ImageNet wins `30 / 35` amplitude-radius cells.
- `14` cells are Holm-significant at family-wise alpha `0.05`.
- `17` cells are BH-significant at FDR `0.05`.

This replaces the historical post-hoc best-branch `8 / 35` number.

## Noise-Floor Diagnostic

The remediated sensitivity grid now has an empirical signal-scale diagnostic:

```bash
python scripts/phase3_noise_floor_analysis.py
```

Current output:

- Median negative-patch RMS is about `99.8 uK`.
- The configured instrument white-noise term is only about `2.3 uK/pixel`, so
  CMB structure, foreground/domain transfer, and mask effects dominate.
- For `A = 1e-6`, support RMS is only about `1.6-2.1 uK`, or `0.016-0.021`
  of the empirical CMB patch RMS.
- For `A = 5e-6`, support RMS is about `7.8-10.4 uK`, still below `0.11` of
  the empirical CMB patch RMS.

Interpretation: low-amplitude recall is expected to remain poor for patch-level
screeners unless the next stage uses stronger priors, full covariance weighting,
or Bayesian/template-fit likelihoods. This is a diagnostic, not an impossibility
proof; a real bound needs the full CMB covariance and foreground residual model.

## Matched-Filter SNR Curves

The ideal harmonic-space Feeney matched-filter SNR diagnostic is:

```bash
python scripts/phase3_matched_filter_snr_curve.py
```

Default output:

- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_matched_filter_snr/matched_filter_snr_report.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_matched_filter_snr/matched_filter_snr_report.md`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_matched_filter_snr/matched_filter_snr_cells.csv`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_matched_filter_snr/matched_filter_snr_profiles.csv`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_matched_filter_snr/matched_filter_snr_curves.png`

The calculation uses the McEwen/OSS first-order additive template convention,
CAMB TT covariance, the repo beam/noise assumptions, and a rough `f_sky` scaling.
It does not close the masked-sky Wiener/SMHW same-grid benchmark by itself.
Current results show `A <= 2e-6` is low-SNR under the fsky proxy, while several
`A >= 1e-5` cells have high ideal matched-filter recall but low current ML
recall. Those higher-SNR cells are algorithmic targets, not physics-impossibility
claims.

## Upper-Limit Calculator

The remediated sensitivity grid now has a source-backed post-processing
calculator for detectable-collision upper limits:

```bash
python scripts/phase3_upper_limit_calculator.py
```

Default output:

- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_upper_limits/upper_limits.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_upper_limits/upper_limits.md`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_upper_limits/upper_limits.csv`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_upper_limits/upper_limit_cell_weights.csv`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_upper_limits/upper_limits.png`

Under the default `log_uniform` amplitude prior and `sin_theta` radius prior,
with zero credible detections at 95% confidence:

| method | mean efficiency | exposure | `Nbar_s^95` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `centered_disc` | `0.2201` | `0.1699` | `17.6292` |
| `circular_template_screen` | `0.3189` | `0.2462` | `12.1677` |
| `imagenet_b64_aux` | `0.3780` | `0.2918` | `10.2674` |
| `random_b64_aux` | `0.3388` | `0.2615` | `11.4544` |

This is an efficiency-weighted Poisson upper limit on the detectable-collision
rate parameter `Nbar_s`. It uses the no-blob form from Feeney et al. Appendix A
and can optionally convert to `lambda H_F^-4` using Feeney et al. Eq. 1 when
`Omega_k` and `H_F/H_I` are supplied. It reports `lambda/B` only when an
explicit model-specific exposure factor is supplied; no universal `lambda/B`
mapping is hard-coded.

Interpretation guardrail: this is a screening-derived detectable-collision
upper-limit proxy built from the synthetic efficiency table. It is not a
masked-sky Bayesian evidence result and should not be framed as a competitive
cosmological constraint.

## Deployment Calibration

Batch 6 reran the full-sky tile audit at `Nside=32`, giving about `11200`
patches per cleaned map and reducing FPR-calibration uncertainty to about
`0.003`.

Tile-recalibrated mixed recall at FPR `0.08`:

| map | `v6_only` | `gbt_6` | `gbt_14` | `gbt_6 - v6` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SMICA | `0.347` | `0.337` | `0.329` | `-0.010` |
| NILC | `0.296` | `0.307` | `0.320` | `+0.011` |
| SEVEM | `0.173` | `0.237` | `0.192` | `+0.065` |
| Commander | `0.161` | `0.230` | `0.193` | `+0.070` |
| mean | `0.244` | `0.278` | `0.258` | `+0.034` |

Interpretation:

- `gbt_6` survives as a **cross-map score-ensemble lever**.
- On SMICA alone, `gbt_6` is marginally worse than `v6_only`.
- `gbt_14` is archived; its geometry features overfit the clean-null
  distribution and do not survive deployment calibration.
- Per-map calibration is mandatory. Do not quote cross-map means as SMICA
  claims.

## Deployment Candidate Burden

The current full-sky candidate-volume table is generated from cached Batch 6
tile features:

```bash
python scripts/phase3_deployment_burden_table.py
```

Default output:

- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_deployment_burden/deployment_burden.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_deployment_burden/deployment_burden.md`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_deployment_burden/deployment_patch_burden.csv`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_deployment_burden/deployment_cluster_burden.csv`

Tile-recalibrated patch burden is about `896` eligible tile candidates per map
at FPR `0.08`, by construction. At `15 deg` greedy peak clustering, mean
clustered burden across the four cleaned maps is:

| method | mean patch candidates | mean recall | mean clusters at `15 deg` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `v6_only` | `896.25` | `0.2440` | `55.00` |
| `gbt_6` | `897.75` | `0.2779` | `69.25` |
| `gbt_14` | `915.50` | `0.2583` | `68.50` |

Interpretation: `gbt_6` remains the best cross-map recall policy after
deployment calibration, but it carries a higher clustered follow-up burden than
`v6_only`. The shipped clean-null thresholds are retained only as drift
diagnostics; on SEVEM and Commander they produce thousands of patch candidates
and must not be used as deployment thresholds.

## Policy Pareto Search

The current recall-vs-FP policy search over existing remediated scores is:

```bash
python scripts/phase3_policy_pareto_search.py
```

Default output:

- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_policy_pareto/policy_pareto.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_policy_pareto/policy_pareto.md`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_policy_pareto/policy_pareto_top.csv`

Best diagnostic policies under selected constraints:

| constraints | best policy | CAMB FPR | real FPR | CAMB recall | real recall | gain vs exact single |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CAMB `<=0.05`, real `<=0.02` | `2-of-3(random>=0.987007, imagenet>=0.947194, circular>=68.79)` | `0.0498` | `0.0200` | `0.3288` | `0.2520` | `+0.0289` |
| CAMB `<=0.05`, real `<=0.05` | `random>=0.994006 OR imagenet>=0.998799` | `0.0398` | `0.0500` | `0.3163` | `0.2671` | `+0.0441` |
| CAMB `<=0.08`, real `<=0.08` | `2-of-3(random>=0.946233, imagenet>=0.947194, circular>=75.0896)` | `0.0706` | `0.0750` | `0.3596` | `0.3028` | `+0.0490` |

Interpretation: there are composite-score policies that recover more recall
than exact-threshold single-score choices under the same diagnostic FPR
budgets. They are not deployment thresholds by themselves.

## Composite-Policy Audits

The Policy-Pareto winners have now been stress-tested two ways:

```bash
python scripts/phase3_remediated_null_policy_audit.py
python scripts/phase3_remediated_policy_tile_audit.py
python scripts/phase3_tile_constrained_policy_search.py
python scripts/phase3_emit_tile_constrained_candidates.py
python scripts/phase3_calibrate_candidate_scores.py
```

Default outputs:

- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_null_policy_audit/null_policy_audit.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_null_policy_audit/null_policy_audit.md`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_policy_tile_audit/policy_tile_audit.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_policy_tile_audit/policy_tile_audit.md`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_deployment_policy_decision/deployment_policy_decision.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_deployment_policy_decision/deployment_policy_decision.md`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_tile_constrained_policy_search/tile_constrained_policy_search.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_tile_constrained_policy_search/tile_constrained_policy_search.md`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_tile_constrained_candidates/candidate_emission_summary.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_tile_constrained_candidates/candidate_records.jsonl`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_tile_constrained_candidates/cluster_representatives_15deg.jsonl`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_projection_clustering_audit/projection_clustering_audit.md`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_template_fit_handoff/template_fit_summary.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_candidate_score_calibration/candidate_score_calibration.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_candidate_score_calibration/calibrated_candidates.jsonl`

On `5976` held-out real-map null-control patches, pooled FPRs remain at a few
percent:

| policy budget | recall diag | null FP | null FPR | 95% CI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CAMB `<=0.05`, real `<=0.02` | `0.2520` | `168 / 5976` | `0.0281` | `[0.0241, 0.0326]` |
| CAMB `<=0.05`, real `<=0.05` | `0.2671` | `147 / 5976` | `0.0246` | `[0.0208, 0.0288]` |
| CAMB `<=0.08`, real `<=0.05` | `0.2778` | `78 / 5976` | `0.0131` | `[0.0103, 0.0163]` |
| CAMB `<=0.08`, real `<=0.08` | `0.3028` | `205 / 5976` | `0.0343` | `[0.0298, 0.0392]` |

The full-sky overlapping-tile audit is more restrictive. At `15 deg` greedy
peak clustering, selected cluster burdens are:

| map | `0.05/0.02` | `0.05/0.05` | `0.08/0.05` | `0.08/0.08` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SMICA | `41` | `41` | `46` | `53` |
| NILC | `34` | `28` | `33` | `39` |
| SEVEM | `64` | `68` | `64` | `72` |
| Commander | `82` | `101` | `71` | `83` |

Interpretation: the larger null-control split does not reproduce the extreme
Commander/SEVEM full-sky tile burden. Do not promote the high-recall
Policy-Pareto winners until candidate-volume criteria are chosen jointly with
cross-map tile burden. In particular, the `0.05/0.05` pair-OR policy has low
SMICA/NILC burden but too many Commander clusters.

The default deployment-decision rule uses `15 deg` clustering, at most `70`
clusters on every cleaned map, at most `0.15` trigger fraction on every map,
and pooled held-out null-control FPR upper CI at most `0.04`. Under that rule,
`0 / 5` composite policies are promotable. The highest-recall row
(`0.08/0.08`) reaches recall `0.3028`, but has `83` Commander clusters and
Commander trigger fraction `0.1772`, so it remains a recall-boost candidate
only.

The broader tile-constrained search uses the same default burden rule but
searches beyond the original Policy-Pareto winners. Current best feasible row:

| policy | real recall | gain vs feasible single | real FPR | pooled null FPR CI high | max clusters | max trigger fraction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `2-of-3(random>=0.999983, imagenet>=0.983177, circular>=51.0957)` | `0.2620` | `+0.0403` | `0.0650` | `0.0290` | `62` Commander | `0.0899` SEVEM |

The best feasible single-score baseline in that same constrained search is
`circular_template_screen >= 73.3128` with recall `0.2216`. The exhaustive
search evaluated all `9582` policies that passed the cheap FPR, pooled-null,
and trigger-fraction filters; no cluster-evaluation cap is active in the
current report. This is the current deployment-safe composite candidate, not a
cosmological detection statistic.

The candidate emitter applies that frozen policy to cached full-sky tile scores
on the canonical science footprint `mask_fraction >= 0.9`. Current emitted
volume:

| map | eligible tiles | tile candidates | eligible trigger frac | cluster reps |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SMICA | `5298` | `41` | `0.0077` | `9` |
| NILC | `5298` | `19` | `0.0036` | `5` |
| SEVEM | `5298` | `17` | `0.0032` | `5` |
| Commander | `5298` | `25` | `0.0047` | `5` |

Use `cluster_representatives_15deg.jsonl` for first-pass HM sign-flip or
template-fit follow-up; `candidate_records.jsonl` preserves all overlapping
tile triggers for provenance.
Projection/clustering systematics for that frozen candidate set live in
`runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_projection_clustering_audit/`.

Candidate score calibration uses the real-map null-control calibration split,
not the held-out test split:

```bash
python scripts/phase3_remediated_null_policy_audit.py \
  --split calibration \
  --output-dir runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_null_policy_calibration
python scripts/phase3_calibrate_candidate_scores.py
```

Current calibrated candidate set: `24` cluster representatives scored against
`5768` pooled calibration-null margins. The most extreme representatives have
plus-one empirical pooled null-survival `p = 0.000173` and BH q-value
`0.000693`. These are screening-tail scores for follow-up prioritization, not
global detection probabilities.

Corrected template-fit and Bayesian handoff artifacts now live in:

- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_template_fit_handoff/`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_bayesian_template_handoff/`

These package deterministic local Feeney-template seeds plus projection-aware
follow-up guardrails. They are handoff artifacts, not Bayesian evidence.

## Matched-Filter-Channel Recall Candidate

The legacy two-channel v7 U-Net branch now has a full-sky tile-burden audit:

```bash
python scripts/phase3_mf_channel_tile_audit.py
```

Default output:

- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_mf_channel_tile_audit/mf_channel_tile_audit.json`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_mf_channel_tile_audit/mf_channel_tile_audit.md`
- `runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_mf_channel_tile_audit/mf_channel_tile_audit.csv`

At the SMICA-recalibrated model threshold for nominal FPR `0.05`, the legacy
checkpoint reaches diagnostic real-SMICA recall `0.3526` at FPR `0.0440`.
The hard regimes remain difficult: recall is `0.0466` for `A <= 2e-6`,
`0.1724` for `5e-6 <= A <= 2e-5`, and `0.9288` for `A >= 5e-5`.

Canonical-footprint full-sky burden is manageable but larger than the frozen
tile-constrained composite:

| map | eligible tiles | eligible triggers | eligible trigger frac | clusters |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SMICA | `5298` | `285` | `0.0538` | `20` |
| NILC | `5298` | `307` | `0.0579` | `21` |
| SEVEM | `5298` | `290` | `0.0547` | `22` |
| Commander | `5298` | `422` | `0.0797` | `23` |

Do not promote this checkpoint as current science. It was trained on the older
`training_v4` feature contract with a legacy `15 arcmin` circular-template
response channel. The result is a strong engineering target for the next
remediated-v1 retrain: cache `features/circular_template_response` with the
current `5 arcmin` beam contract, retrain a two-channel U-Net, then rerun the
same real-null, tile-burden, candidate-calibration, and HM preflight gates.

## Classical Comparators

Historical `matched_template` reports are not true Wiener matched filters. They
are now named `circular_template_screen`.

Current naming contract:

- `circular_template_screen`: patch-space circular disc/ring correlation
  screen; useful as a simple classical comparator and candidate sanity check.
- `wiener_feeney_matched_filter`: harmonic-space Feeney template with beam,
  HEALPix pixel-window, and CMB/noise inverse-covariance weighting.
- `smhw_screen`: spherical Mexican-hat / scale-space context screen.

The true Wiener/SMHW full-sky score-map implementation lives in
`scripts/phase3_classical_filters.py`. Any headline ML-vs-classical claim must
state exactly which comparator was used.

The same-grid true-classical status report is:

```bash
python scripts/phase3_classical_same_grid_status.py
```

A small, non-claim pilot that exercises the full-sky benchmark path is:

```bash
python scripts/phase3_same_grid_fullsky_benchmark.py \
  --max-rows 64 \
  --skip-ml
```

Current output is `complete` for the stratified same-grid manifest in
`runs/phase3_unet/remediated_v1_same_grid_fullsky_manifest/`.

Current same-grid summary on that fixed manifest:

- mean recall: Wiener `0.3841`, ImageNet U-Net `0.3517`, random-init U-Net
  `0.2994`, SMHW `0.2734`
- ImageNet beats Wiener in `17 / 35` raw cells, loses in `16 / 35`, ties in `2`
- under non-overlapping exact 95% CIs, ImageNet is better in `7` cells and
  worse in `8`

Interpretation: the true Wiener/Feeney matched filter is the strongest average
screener on the closed same-grid benchmark, but the ImageNet U-Net keeps
localized wins in selected amplitude/radius cells. That supports a
complementary-screening claim, not uniform ML superiority over the true
Wiener/SMHW comparators. For remediated synthetic products, keep
`--pixel-window-policy synfast_pixwin_true` aligned with
`synfast(pixwin=True)`.

For the benchmark-design fork, generators expose `--injection-convention`.
Use `feeney2011_full_temperature_modulation` for remediated products and
`mcewen2012_first_order_additive` for explicit additive full-sky benchmark
products. If Feeney-modulated products are scored with additive filters instead,
quote the `phase2_physics_checks.py` cross-term report as a direction-specific
approximation check; do not treat it as a universal bound.

## Not Solved

- Weak-family recall remains unsolved. The matched-filter SNR report supports a
  CMB-confusion explanation for `A <= 2e-6`, but it also exposes algorithmic
  headroom in higher-SNR cells where ideal recall is high and ML recall is low.
- The noise-floor diagnostic is still useful as a patch-RMS scale check, but it
  should not be phrased as the central physical limit without the matched-filter
  and same-grid classical results.
- The real-SMICA injection diagnostic still has material FPR inflation for the
  ImageNet branch (`0.372` recall / `0.185` FPR), so it is a transfer diagnostic,
  not a deployment result.
- The same-grid Wiener/SMHW benchmark is now closed on the stratified manifest
  and shows Wiener as the strongest average screener. What remains open is how
  to use that result in deployment: score fusion, the now-completed
  true-Wiener two-stream branch, and projection-robust follow-up still need
  final policy decisions.
- The legacy matched-filter-channel checkpoint improves diagnostic recall, but
  is not promoted because it was trained before `remediated_v1`. It now has a
  tile-burden audit and should be replaced by a remediated two-channel retrain
  before paper-facing claims.
- Half-mission sign-flip calibration is implemented as a Phase 5 downstream
  CLI. The preflight report validates the frozen `24` cluster representatives,
  policy slug, model checkpoints, and common mask, but is currently `blocked`
  because HM1/HM2 cleaned-map paths have not been provided.
- There is no Bayesian parameter inference or model comparison against
  LambdaCDM.
- Candidate-volume accounting exists, but the paper-facing deployment section
  still needs a final cluster radius and score-calibration convention.

## Next Work

1. Decide how to use the completed remediated true-Wiener two-stream branch in
   the active comparison set.
   Status update:
   the corrected full-cache rerun is complete. `true_wiener_ft` raises mean
   sensitivity from `0.34875` to `0.36839` overall (`+0.01964`), helps
   moderate/high-amplitude cells (`+0.03881` mean delta) and large-radius cells
   (`+0.02226`), but still hurts the hardest low-amplitude subset
   (`-0.00592`). Treat it as a promising secondary branch, not a default
   replacement, until deployment burden or score-fusion tests are closed.
2. Select/provide Planck HM1/HM2 component-separated map paths, rerun the Phase
   5 preflight, then run HM sign-flip calibration on the frozen cluster
   representatives.
3. Choose and justify the paper-facing cluster radius for deployment burden
   using the completed projection/clustering audit, rather than the old fixed
   `15 deg` convention by default.
4. Promote the deterministic template-fit and Bayesian handoff into the
   follow-up narrative for the frozen `24` cluster representatives, then add
   native-sphere or projection-robust follow-up for the `17` projection-caution
   candidates.
5. Prioritize real-map null backgrounds over another CAMB-only branch.
6. Feed screened candidates into template fitting, Bayesian follow-up, and
   `scripts/phase5_half_mission_signflip_null.py` when HM inputs are available.
